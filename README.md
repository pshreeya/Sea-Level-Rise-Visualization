# Sea-Level-Rise-Visualization
This project presents the rise of sea levels of different countries in the world from 1993-2023. It uses data from the US Gouvernment (https://earth.gov/sealevel/sea-level-explorer/). The project also simulates the sea level rise projection of Tokyo City, Japan from 2020-2050. 

# Why did I choose this dataset?
One of the biggest yet underestimated threats we face today is rising sea levels. With climate change accelerating, sea levels have been rising at alarming rates in recent years. It’s shocking to think that some of the world’s most iconic coastal cities like New York, Mumbai, London, etc and vacation beach spots like Maldives, Aruba, etc could be underwater in the near future if we don’t take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent glaciers from melting.
This issue resonantes with me personally, as I have a deep connection to Mangaluru, Karnataka a coastal city in India that I love visiting for pilgrimage trips. The thought of places like these being swallowed by the ocean is both heartbreaking and terrifying.

# How to use it?
1. Download the Immersive Web Emulator Chrome Extension (allows you to simulate a WebXR device in a desktop browser). Click here to see a quick tutorial: https://p5xr.org/#/quick-start/emulator OR
2. Connect with your VR Headset (works better with Oculus)
3. See the legend to understand the data being presented on the 3D globe
4. Use the left handstick to rotate the 3D globe. 
5. Use the right handstick to transport to Tokyo, Japan and start the sea level rise flooding simulation.
